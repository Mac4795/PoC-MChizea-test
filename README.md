# PoC-MChizea-test

A proof of concept to test whether I am able to download files from a GitHub repository and copy them to an Azure repository using Azure pipeline. The pipline should allow the user to update and copy files from GitHub to Azure. 

The idea is to be able to use files that are freely available on github and keep them up to date without having to create new Azure repo every time the github repo is updated. The pipeline yaml file proves that this is possible.
